I improved a previous website that I created and then deployed it in Azure.

The improvements included:

- Making the website responsive through the use of Bootstrap
- Adding a navigation bar
- Adding a visitor counter that tracks the number of times that the page has been viewed (this was created using Cosmos DB and Azure Functions)
